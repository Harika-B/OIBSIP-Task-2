          <h2> Prime Minister of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Jawahar Lal Nehru was an Indian independence fighter and the first prime minister of India.
                He was considered as a central warrior in Indian Politics before independence as well as
                after independence.He was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad and served the nation from 
                1947 until his death in 1964.The birthplace of Jawahar Lal Nehru is Prayagraj which is in 
                Ahmedabad.Due to his association with the Kashmiri Pandit community, he was also known as 
                Pandit Nehru, while the Indian kids referred to them as Chacha Nehru.Jawahar Lal Nehru’s 
                birthday is widely celebrated as children’s day.His father’s name is Motilal Nehru who 
                served as Indian Prime minister in 1919 and 1928. His mother’s name is Swarup Rani Thussu 
                and she was the second wife of Motilal’s.

          <h3>Achivements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
                In the 35 years from 1929, when Gandhi chose Nehru as president of the Congress session at 
                Lahore, until his death, as prime minister, in 1964, Nehru remained—despite the debacle of 
                the brief conflict with China in 1962—the idol of his people. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Nehru’s star was in the ascendant until October 1956, when India’s attitude on the Hungarian 
                Revolution against the Soviets brought his policy of nonalignment (neutralism) under sharp 
                scrutiny by the noncommunist countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                By the time of the first conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade, 
                Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), in 1961, Nehru had substituted nonalignment for anticolonialism 
                as his most-pressing concern.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the United Nations, India was the only nonaligned country to vote with the Soviet Union 
                on the invasion of Hungary, and it was thereafter difficult for Nehru to command credence in 
                his calls for nonalignment.
